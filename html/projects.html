                    As part of an advanced functional programming seminar, Jayme Woogerd, Andrew Mendelsohn, and I are developing a tool to help composers hear variations of their peices.  The variations are developed by treating the composition as a game amongst each instrument participating.  We are writing this tool in Haskell, and using <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/euterpea/">Euterpea</a> to simulate the music, and <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~walkiner/projects/hagl.html">Hagl</a> to simulate the game.

                    <a href="http://sites.tufts.edu/blockytalky/">Blocky Talky</a> is a project being worked on by the Center for Education Engineering and Outreach at Tufts Universiy.  William Stone, Gabe Siu, Eliot Alter, and I are fleshing out the back end.  We will be implementing an account management system and expand the extent to which the units can communicate with eachother and other internet services.

                    This project was started at Music Hack Day 2013 (when it was discovered to be much more difficult than originally thought).  We proposed to make mash-ups from many covers of a single song.  The musical recognition of different parts of the song is incredibly difficult, never-mind their integration into one piece.  This project is now in the stage of researching "is it even at all possible?" as our hackathon effors proved fruitless. We'll see how it goes with sleeping at regular intervals.
