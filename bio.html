<h1>A little about me...</h1>

<p>
I grew up in central Connecticut and have never moved except from school to school.
  I attended a boarding high school for four years before starting at Tufts University in
 2010.  Though I always knew I wanted to be an engineer (building things and solving
 puzzles has always been a passion of mine), I jumped around between many disciplines
 before settling down in computer science. I have since spent a lot of time exploring
 parallel computing, and hope to continue work in that field after graduation in 2014.
