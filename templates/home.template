            <p class="lead section-lead">Welcome to my website!  This is the space where I keep track of the projects I'm working on and experiment with new web development tools!</p>
            <p class="section-paragraph">I'm a senior studying computer science at Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts.  If I'm not behind my computer building software, you'll find me in a tree on the academic quad or gallivanting through Boston's many great music venues.  I play 10+ instruments poorly, but have always had phantom dreams of becoming a great performer.  I'm in the process of figuring out the rest of my life, so if you have any tips, send 'em my way!</p>
